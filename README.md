# VIGENÈRE CIPHER
The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher invented by Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. 
In this cipher, a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers are used to encrypt the plaintext. The encryption key is a word or phrase called the "keyword". 
The keyword is repeated to form a key that is as long as the plaintext. 
Each letter of the key is then used to encrypt the corresponding letter of the plaintext using a Caesar cipher. 

The Vigenère cipher is more secure than a simple Caesar cipher because the ciphertext does not exhibit periodicity, and therefore frequency analysis is more difficult. However, it is still 
susceptible to a variety of cryptanalytic attacks, including the Kasiski examination and the Friedman test.
